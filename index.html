        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The term “Semantic Web” refers to W3C's vision of the Web of linked data. 
        Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, 
        build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data.</p>

        <p>The Semantic Web is a vision about an extension of the existing World Wide Web, 
        which provides software programs with machine-interpretable metadata of the 
        published information and data. In other words, we add further data descriptors 
        to otherwise existing content and data on the Web.</p>

        <p>
          What is Semantic Web used for?<br>
          The Semantic Web aims to enrich the Web with a layer of machine-interpretable metadata
           so that computer programs can predictably derive new information. This goal
            will require the development of metadata syntax and vocabularies, and 
            the creation of metadata for lots of Web pages.
        </p>

        <!-- it's good practice to include a header for each <section> or <article> -->
        
          <h3>What will we learn?</h3>
        <p>This course introduces students to web development with the goal of designing a
        website containing structured and semantic data and that adheres to principles 
        of usability, accessibility, and inclusion. By the end of this course, 
        students will acquire skills at planning, developing, organizing, and
        managing websites in HTML5 and CSS3 and will develop an understanding of
        basic design principles and project management.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How Semantic Web technology fits into the past, present, and future evolution of the Internet.</li>
            <li>How Semantic Web technology differs from existing data management technologies, such as relational 
                databases and the current state of the World Wide Web.</li>
            <li>The three primary international standards that help encode the Semantic Web.</li>

        <h2>HTML - Structuring the web</h2>

        <article id="sub_article">

        <p>To build websites, you should know about HTML — the fundamental technology used to 
          define the structure of a webpage. <q><i><b> HTML is used to specify whether your web content 
          should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, 
          form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.</b></i></q>
        </p>

        <h3>CSS</h3>

        <img srcset="images/css_image-small.png 200w, images/css_image-large.png 500w"
        sizes="(max-width: 772px) 200px, 400px"  
        src="images/css_image-large.png"
        alt="graphic of CSS logo with a boy standing infront of a laptop "> 
        <!-- If the max width display is 772px then display 500px image if not display the 300px image -->

        <p>
          After learning HTML, you can then move on to learning about more advanced topics such as: 
          CSS, and how to use it to style HTML (for example, alter your text size and fonts used, 
          add borders and drop shadows, layout your page with multiple columns, add animations and other visual effects).
          JavaScript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages (for example, 
          find your location and plot it on a map, make UI elements appear/disappear when you toggle a button, 
          save users' data locally on their computers, and much more).<br>

        <h3>JSON</h3>
        </p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
        It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines 
        to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript 
        Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.<br> 
        JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses 
        conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, 
        including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. 
        These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
      </p>
      <p>
        JSON is built on two structures:<br>
        
        <ul><li>A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an 
        object, record, struct, dictionary, 
        hash table, keyed list, or associative array. </li>
        <li>An ordered list of values. 
        In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.
      </li></ul>
        These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming 
        languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that 
        a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also 
        be based on these structures.<br>
        Source: <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html"> Json.org (External Link)</a>
        </p>

        
          <h3>JSON-LD</h3>
          <p>
          JSON-LD stands for JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data, which consists of multi-dimensional arrays 
          (think: list of attribute-value pairs). <br>

          It is an implementation format for structuring data analogous 
          to Microdata and RDFa. Typically, in terms of SEO, JSON-LD is implemented leveraging the Schema.org vocabulary, 
          a joint effort by Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and Yandex in 2011 to create a unified structured data vocabulary for the web. 
          (However, Bing and other search engines have not officially stated their support of JSON-LD implementations of Schema.org.)<br>

          JSON-LD is considered to be simpler to implement, due to the ability to simply paste the markup within the HTML document,
          versus having to wrap the markup around HTML elements (as one would do with Microdata). <br>
